# Google Removal Form Step One

This file contains a large React component with issues. I need to fix the `renderStarRating` function.

Requirements:
- When rating is below 4.0 stars, show yellow stars with a message that the business profile should be removed as it's losing customers due to bad reviews
- When rating is below 3.3 stars, show red stars with a more prominent message about losing many customers
